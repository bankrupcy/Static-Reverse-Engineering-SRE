# Static Reverse Engineering [SRE]
### SRE - Dissecting Malware for Static Analysis & the Complete Command-line Tool

SRE is designed to dissect the binary files (such as EXE, DLL file types) for Static Analysis, such as malware samples, to extract valuable data without executing the file. Its built with a comprehensive set of analysis techniques and generates text files containing the outcomes for further analysis or report creation, also very juicy data for Dynamic Analysis.


 ### <u> **Key Features:** </u>
**Static Analysis:** The tool performs static analysis, which means it examines the binary file without executing or running it. This helps in understanding the characteristics and potential behavior of the file.

**Textfile based Output:** The tool saves the analysis outcome as text file. This format is chosen to facilitate easy readable-format (copy/paste), review, and further analysis of the collected information. It allows analysts to search, filter, and process the data efficiently.  Also makes it very easy to write custom *'Yara rules'*.

**200+ Checkpoints:** The tool encompasses more than 200 checkpoints categorized into nine distinct categories. These checkpoints cover a wide range of analysis techniques, aiming to provide a comprehensive data of the binary file.


### **Categories of Analysis:**
By performing a thorough analysis across the following nine categories which contains 200+ checkpoints (will increase occasionally), this provides a extensive knowledge of the binary file's characteristics, behavior, and potential risks.

-   Integrity Analyse
-   Metadata Analyse
-   Packers Detection
-   APIs Analyse
-   Strings Analyse
-   IoCs Extraction
-   Malicious Behaviour Analyse
-   Disasmembly Dump
-   VirusTotal Check &emsp;&emsp; _<Note: this will not submit the samples to VT.>_

It's a command line tool to perform static reverse engineering on malicious Windows binary files (exe, dll). It will dump all the outcome as text files under the *analysis_result_<binaryfilename>* directory generated by this tool. Since all the outcome as text files it would much easier for further analysis and/or create detailed report.

TIP:  If the binary file's name as *'malware.exe'*, recommended rename it as *'malware_exe'* to create meaningful output directory and file names.

**Advantages:**
- The complete command-line tool with text files as output. <First of it's kind, I guess!>
- The outcome text files makes useful in further analyze the results and/or create a detailed report and to write custom Yara rules.  Also these dump very handy during Dynamic Analysis of this sample.
- It is a command line tool, which makes it easy to use and automate, also can be customized further for more indepth during dynamic analysis research.

**Limitations:**
-  No GUI treats!  Its all command-line.
-  Supports only EXE, DLL file formates (as of now).


### Requirements
Python 3.10 and above.

Use '_requirements.txt_' file for the pre-requisite installation packages and and they will be installed using:
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;   *_pip install -r requirements.txt_*

Here are the full list of Python packages as requirements, in case if you need it.
- re, math, magic, yara
- os, sys, subprocess, platform
- pefile, lief
- json, requests
- datetime, time
- hashlib, argparse

_Note:_ It works perfect on Linux with colorful command-line. It also works on Windows, but use '_SREwin.py_' file.
